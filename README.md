 - Each test case has a unique "id".

 - Folder "results" contains results for 54 consecutive runs of 2661 automated UI test cases from September 27th to November 15th in 2018.
 
 - For each file in the "results" folder, if a certain id does not occur, that test case is skipped for that run.

 - File "test_feature.csv" contains the featurized test case descriptions for each test case.
